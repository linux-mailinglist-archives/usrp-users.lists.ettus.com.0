I have a series of N320s sprinkled across our lab and I would like to cha=
nge their names so it is clear where they are located (as opposed to keep=
ing a list of which serial number is where), is this possible?  i could h=
ave sworn I could do this with a different Ettus device in the past, but =
I can=E2=80=99t recall which one.  I know some of them could have their h=
ostnames changed, but I don=E2=80=99t think that it is possible to do tha=
t statically on the N320.  Thoughts?
