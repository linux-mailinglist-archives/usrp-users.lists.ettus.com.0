Dear List,

I would like to inform you that the Software Defined Radio Academy 2020
is taking place the upcoming weekend on June 27 / 28. 

We decided very early that we would organize it as a video conference:
The talks are all pre-recorded, but the speakers will attend in our
BigBlueButton server, so there will be some kind of feedback and
interaction. 

The audience can ask their questions in written form in your Youtube
stream, and the speakers will respond accordingly. 

Here is the (forwarder) URL of our stream:

https://youtube.sdra.io

Please find the programme here: 

https://2020.sdra.io/pages/programme.html

Going virtual gave us the opportunity to host many more speakers who
would not need to travel to Friedrichshafen as in the past years. So we
decided to split the conference into two days, allowing us to start a
little later, which gives the overseas audience a chance to attend. 

Besides this, our mother organisation, the German Amateur Radio Club,
will also host this year's HAMRADIO conference as a virtual conference.
For those of you who speak German, please consider the programme, which
is nostly ready now. Alltogether we recorded and produced more than 60
hours of technical talks, discussions and recreational movies, so it's
worth a look:
