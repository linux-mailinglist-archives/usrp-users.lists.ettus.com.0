Hi Martin,

=C2=B7 Yes, the output on the erroneous device has been generated by runn=
ing that command when i am logged into the device via SSH.=20

=C2=B7 I have checked the Ip configurations, which they are 192.168.0.3 f=
or the good device, 192.168.0.4 for the erroneous, 192.168.0.10 for the h=
ost (which only have 1 because i plugged and unplugged the devices so the=
y have been tested separately) and DHCP 192.168.0.255.

=C2=B7 Also the subnet and subnet mask are configurated the same for all =
the network (ettus devices and host).

I am going to check out the manual that you send to me via link and see i=
f i have set up anything wrong.

Also in my first tries to make the devices run, I have configured the set=
 up as you remarked in the reply, but suddenly when all goes wrong I only=
 have tested the devices with the RJ45 connection. I will try to let the =
configuration as you recommended, but when i did i had the same issue.=20

Thank you so much for the quick reply.
