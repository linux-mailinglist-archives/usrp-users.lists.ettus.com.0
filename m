Oh, okay, I didn=E2=80=99t get that.  Understood now.  I have UHD 3.14.0 =

works as such, you can connect to the debug UART header and get printout =
information from the firmware at boot time. Another good idea would be =
to take a video of the front panel LEDs as you apply power -- the boot =
LED lights give good indication of the firmware/FPGA image loading =

    Theoretically, most versions in the last several years should be
    able to talk to it.&nbsp; In *general* UHD never drops support for =
older
    hardware,<br class=3D"">
    &nbsp; and tries to maintain compatibility.&nbsp; Now, it is the =
case that
    newer features are almost never "back-ported", but basic
    functionality should<br class=3D"">
    &nbsp; always be there.&nbsp; <br class=3D"">
    <br class=3D"">
    What this *should* mean is that you should be able to use the
    firmware tools once the device is in "safe mode" to get yourself to
    where you<br class=3D"">
    &nbsp; want to be.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, that may well mean =
that the
